    <p>I am a dedicated and passionate computer science student with a strong desire to develop my technical skills and contribute to the field. Through my studies and in my own free time, I have gained expertise in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C#, I also am self taught in Unity and know enough HTML and CSS to piece together this little site. I am a detail-oriented problem solver with excellent communication skills and a team player mindset. My ultimate goal is to apply my skills and knowledge to help organizations and businesses leverage technology to improve efficiency and productivity.
